## Chalk Radio Episode

“We don't do a lot of teaching,” says Dr. Ari Epstein in an interview in the episode of the Chalk Radio podcast embedded below. Dr. Epstein is associate director of the Terrascope learning community for first-year undergraduates. Each year the program focuses on one particular issue relating to sustainability, and participants in the program learn by direct experience, launching themselves into projects focused on solving complex environmental problems. The role of the program’s instructional staff, Dr. Epstein says, is to create an environment where learning can happen, rather than to impart knowledge or teach skills directly. Toward the end of the semester, the students create a website describing their proposed solutions in as much technical detail as they can. And then a week later, they present their proposals in front of an invited panel of outside experts. In the process of preparing for this presentation, students often come to realize that understanding the history and cultural implications of an issue are just as important as understanding the science behind it and the technology available for dealing with it.

## Bonus Episode

In a departure from the usual format of the Chalk Radio podcast, in which we interview an exceptional faculty member to learn about their approach to teaching, the episode embedded below showcases an exemplary piece of student work: an exploration of ways in which seemingly everyday places and activities, such as a cornfield, the meeting place of two rivers, or the process of planting and tending crops, are imbued with sacredness in Diné (Navajo) tradition. This episode was created by first-year students as a semester-long project in the course *SP.360 Terrascope Radio* as part of MIT Terrascope, a learning community for first-year undergraduate students focused on solving complex environmental problems. Follow along with the Terrascope students as they visit the Navajo Nation and learn firsthand about how the Diné people’s traditional relationship with the land survives as a powerful force in their lives, both shaping their response to environmental issues and marking their identity as a distinct people.
